## Our Beliefs

We believe that in the age of AI-assisted development, **technical decisions** are the cornerstone of sustainable software systems. While Agile methodologies revolutionized how we deliver software, they inadvertently left architectural governance as an afterthought. We propose a new paradigm that treats decisions as first-class citizens in the development process.

---

## The DDSE Principles

### 1. Decisions Over Documentation
We value **living decision records** over static documentation. Every significant technical choice should be captured with its context, alternatives, and rationaleâ€”not as bureaucracy, but as the DNA of our system's evolution.

### 2. Explicit Over Implicit
We make architectural and design decisions **explicitly visible** rather than hoping they emerge organically. AI tools and human developers alike benefit from clear guardrails and intent.

### 3. Evolution Over Stagnation
We embrace **continuous decision refactoring**â€”updating, superseding, and evolving our technical choices as we learn, just as we refactor code to maintain its health.

### 4. Alignment Over Chaos
We ensure **human-AI collaboration** through shared understanding. AI assistants should accelerate development within our architectural intent, not work against it.

### 5. Traceability Over Tribal Knowledge
We create **transparent decision trails** that survive team changes, management transitions, and organizational growth. Knowledge belongs to the system, not just individuals.

### 6. Lightweight Over Heavy
We practice **just-enough governance**â€”capturing decisions that matter without drowning in documentation overhead. Significance trumps completeness.

### 7. Continuous Over Phase-Gated
We integrate **decision management into daily workflow** rather than treating it as a separate governance activity. Decisions flow with development, not against it.

## The DDSE Promise

By adopting Decision-Driven Software Engineering, teams will achieve:

- **Reduced Architectural Drift**: Systems that maintain coherence over time
- **AI-Safe Development**: AI tools that enhance rather than undermine architecture
- **Accelerated Onboarding**: New team members who understand system reasoning quickly
- **Improved Maintainability**: Code with clear decision lineage and rationale
- **Enhanced Stakeholder Trust**: Transparent technical choices and their business impact
- **Sustainable Velocity**: Technical decisions that enable rather than impede delivery

## Our Commitment

We, the DDSE community, commit to:

1. **Open Collaboration**: Sharing practices, tools, and learnings openly
2. **Continuous Improvement**: Evolving DDSE based on real-world experience
3. **Inclusive Community**: Welcoming diverse perspectives and use cases
4. **Practical Focus**: Prioritizing real value over theoretical perfection
5. **Industry Advancement**: Elevating software engineering practices for all

## Call to Action

Software engineering stands at an inflection point. AI capabilities are transforming how we build systems, but without proper guidance, they risk creating architectural chaos. DDSE offers a path forwardâ€”one that harnesses AI's power while preserving human architectural wisdom.

Join us in making technical decisions visible, valuable, and vital to software success.
