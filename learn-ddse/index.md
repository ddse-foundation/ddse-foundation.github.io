## Overview

Decision-Driven Software Engineering (DDSE) is a methodological framework that integrates systematic decision documentation with AI-assisted development processes. This section provides comprehensive learning resources to understand and apply DDSE principles in your development practice.

## Learning Path

### 1. Foundation: Understanding DDSE

**[Manifesto]({% link learn-ddse/manifesto.md %})**
: Explore the philosophical foundation and core principles that drive the DDSE methodology

### 2. Technical Framework: DDSE Specification  

**[Specification]({% link learn-ddse/specification.md %})**
: Complete technical specification for implementing Decision-Driven Software Engineering

### 3. Contract-Driven Development: SDLC Integration

**[Contracts in SDLC]({% link learn-ddse/sdlc-contracts.md %})**
: How Contract Decision Records transform greenfield development through systematic API design

### 4. Historical Context: Decision Memory

**[Decision Memory]({% link learn-ddse/decision-memory.md %})**
: Understanding the evolution of decision documentation approaches in software engineering

## Key Concepts

### Human-AI Collaboration
DDSE ensures that **human intelligence defines the WHAT and WHY** of software decisions, while **artificial intelligence accelerates the HOW** of implementation.

### Technical Decision Records (TDRs)
Structured documents that capture technical decisions with specific sections for AI guidance, creating a bridge between human decision-making and AI implementation.

### Decision Hierarchy
A systematic approach to organizing decisions from strategic (MDD) through architectural (ADR) to implementation-specific (IDR) levels.
