## Examples

This section presents practical implementations of Decision-Driven Software Engineering methodology, demonstrating how Technical Decision Records guide software development from strategic decisions to implementation details.

## Available Examples

The DDSE Foundation provides two complementary examples based on the TaskFlow project, illustrating different aspects of the methodology:

### TaskFlow Decision Documentation (`task-app-tdr-only`)

**Purpose**: Demonstrates comprehensive TDR creation as the foundation for AI-assisted development

**Scope**: Complete decision memory for a simple task management API designed for small teams (2-10 people)

## TaskFlow Decision Documentation Framework

The TaskFlow examples demonstrate systematic implementation of DDSE methodology through a practical task management system. These examples illustrate the complete methodology from strategic decision documentation through implementation traceability.

### Decision Documentation Example (`task-app-tdr-only`)

**Methodological Focus**: Comprehensive TDR creation as foundation for consistent development

**Project Scope**: Task management API for small teams with explicit time and complexity constraints

**Technical Decision Hierarchy**:

- **MDD-001**: Product strategy defining essential functionality and deployment constraints
- **ADR-001**: REST API architectural choice with JSON request/response patterns  
- **ADR-002**: SQLite data storage strategy with SQLAlchemy ORM integration
- **EDR-001**: JWT authentication implementation with team-based authorization
- **EDR-002**: Structured error handling approach with consistent response formats
- **IDR-001**: API endpoint naming conventions following RESTful principles
- **IDR-002**: Input validation patterns using Pydantic model specifications

**AI Integration Framework**: Each TDR includes structured AI context sections providing:

- Implementation priority guidance directing development sequence
- Framework-specific recommendations for technology application
- Constraint enforcement rules ensuring architectural compliance
- Validation requirements for automated quality assurance

**Methodological Contribution**: Demonstrates how systematic decision documentation creates reusable context for both human developers and AI tools, enabling consistent implementation across iterations.

### Implementation Traceability Example (`task-app-python`)

**Methodological Focus**: Direct translation of documented decisions into maintainable code structures

**Implementation Framework**: FastAPI-based REST API implementing TaskFlow specifications

**Decision-to-Code Traceability**:

- **Strategic Alignment**: Code structure directly reflects MDD-001 constraints for rapid deployment
- **Architectural Compliance**: API endpoints implement ADR-001 RESTful conventions precisely
- **Data Layer Consistency**: Database models follow ADR-002 SQLAlchemy patterns exactly
- **Security Implementation**: Authentication follows EDR-001 JWT specifications completely
- **Error Handling**: Response patterns implement EDR-002 structured error formats
- **API Conventions**: Endpoint design follows IDR-001 naming standards systematically
- **Validation Patterns**: Input handling implements IDR-002 Pydantic specifications

**Code Reference System**: Implementation includes explicit TDR references in comments, linking specific code sections to their governing decisions.

**Quality Assurance**: Includes automated validation demonstrating compliance with documented decision criteria.

## Learning Through Examples

### For Methodology Understanding

**Decision Documentation Process**: Study `task-app-tdr-only` to understand how technical decisions are systematically captured, structured, and connected in a hierarchy from strategic to implementation-specific choices.

**Implementation Guidance**: Examine `task-app-python` to see how documented decisions translate into consistent code patterns, architectural compliance, and maintainable software structures.

### For Practical Application

**TDR Creation**: Use TaskFlow examples as templates for documenting technical decisions in your projects, adapting the hierarchy and content structure to your specific domain and requirements.

**AI Collaboration**: Apply the AI context patterns demonstrated in TaskFlow TDRs to enable effective collaboration between human decision-makers and AI development tools.

## Academic Analysis Framework

### Decision Methodology Evaluation

The TaskFlow examples enable systematic evaluation of DDSE methodology effectiveness through:

**Decision Quality Metrics**: Analysis of how explicit decision documentation affects implementation consistency, architectural compliance, and maintenance efficiency.

**Traceability Assessment**: Measurement of relationship clarity between strategic choices and implementation details through the documented decision hierarchy.

**AI Integration Effectiveness**: Evaluation of how structured decision context improves AI-generated code quality and architectural alignment.

### Implementation Quality Assessment

**Architectural Consistency**: Comparative analysis of implementation adherence to documented architectural decisions across different system components.

**Pattern Compliance**: Systematic evaluation of code pattern consistency relative to documented implementation decisions and conventions.

**Maintenance Predictability**: Assessment of how decision documentation supports understanding and modification of existing system components.
