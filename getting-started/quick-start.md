## Step 1: Choose Your Decision (1 minute)

Pick a **recent technical decision** you made. Great candidates:

### üéØ API Design Decisions
- "How should we handle input validation?"
- "What error response format should we use?"
- "How should we structure our endpoints?"

### üèóÔ∏è Code Organization Decisions  
- "How should we organize our database queries?"
- "What naming convention should we use for functions?"
- "How should we handle configuration?"

### üîß Tool Configuration Decisions
- "What linting rules should we enforce?"
- "How should we structure our test files?"
- "What CI/CD pipeline should we use?"

**For this example, let's use: "API Input Validation Strategy"**

---

## Step 2: Download Template (30 seconds)

For our example decision, we'll use an **IDR (Implementation Decision Record)** template:

**Option A: Copy from GitHub**
1. Go to [IDR Template](https://github.com/ddse-foundation/ddse-foundation/blob/main/tdr-templates/idr-template.md)
2. Copy the raw markdown content
3. Save as `idr-001-input-validation.md` in your project

**Option B: Use our generator**
1. Visit our [Interactive TDR Builder]({% link implementation/templates/interactive-builder.md %})
2. Select "IDR - Implementation Decision"
3. Download the customized template

---

## Step 3: Fill Your TDR (3 minutes)

Replace the template content with your actual decision:

```yaml
---
decision_id: "idr-001"
title: "API Input Validation Strategy"
status: "accepted"
decision_type: "implementation"
created: "2025-01-27"
author: "Your Name"

# Decision Context

We need consistent input validation across all API endpoints. Currently, different endpoints handle validation differently, leading to inconsistent error messages and security gaps.

## Current State
- Some endpoints use manual validation
- Error messages vary between endpoints  
- No standardized validation failure responses

## Decision Drivers
- Security: Prevent invalid data from reaching business logic
- Consistency: Uniform validation patterns across all endpoints
- Developer Experience: Clear error messages for API consumers
- Maintainability: Centralized validation logic

# Decision Outcome

We will use **Pydantic models for all API input validation** with FastAPI's built-in integration.

## Selected Option
**Option 1: Pydantic models with FastAPI dependency injection**

### Implementation Details
- All API endpoints will define Pydantic models for request bodies
- Use FastAPI's automatic validation and error handling
- Return standardized 422 errors for validation failures
- Custom error messages for business-specific validation rules

## Consequences

### Positive
- Automatic request validation with minimal boilerplate
- Type hints improve IDE support and documentation
- Consistent error response format across all endpoints
- Easy to test validation logic in isolation

### Negative  
- Additional dependency on Pydantic
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Pydantic
- Migration effort for existing endpoints

# AI Context

## Implementation Priority
Implement validation decorators first, then migrate existing endpoints in order of business criticality. Start with user registration and authentication endpoints.

## Framework Guidance
- Use FastAPI's dependency injection system for reusable validation logic
- Create base validator classes for common patterns (email, phone, etc.)
- Leverage Pydantic's built-in validators for standard formats
- Use custom validators for business-specific rules

## Constraint Enforcement
- MUST return 422 status code for validation errors
- MUST include field-level error details in response
- NEVER accept unvalidated input in any endpoint handler
- MUST log validation failures for security monitoring

## Pattern Examples
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr, validator
from fastapi import HTTPException

class UserRegistrationRequest(BaseModel):
    email: EmailStr
    password: str
    full_name: str
    
    @validator('password')
    def validate_password(cls, v):
        if len(v) < 8:
            raise ValueError('Password must be at least 8 characters')
        return v

@app.post("/users/register")
async def register_user(request: UserRegistrationRequest):
    # Input is automatically validated by FastAPI + Pydantic
    # Business logic here knows input is valid
    pass
```

# Related Decisions

- edr-001-error-handling-strategy.md (Defines error response format)
```

## Step 4: Test with AI Tools (1 minute)

Now use your TDR with your favorite AI tool:

### With GitHub Copilot
1. Open your project in VS Code
2. Create a new API endpoint file
3. Add a comment: `// Following idr-001-input-validation.md, create user registration endpoint`
4. Watch Copilot generate code following your TDR patterns

### With ChatGPT/Claude
1. Copy your TDR content
2. Ask: "Following this TDR, implement a user registration endpoint for our FastAPI application"
3. Compare the generated code with your documented patterns

### Expected Result
The AI should generate code that:
- ‚úÖ Uses Pydantic models for validation
- ‚úÖ Returns 422 errors for invalid input
- ‚úÖ Includes proper error handling
- ‚úÖ Follows the exact patterns you documented

---

## Step 5: Validate Your TDR (30 seconds)

Check if your TDR follows DDSE best practices:

**Option A: Online Validator**
1. Use the [GitHub TDR Validator](https://github.com/ddse-foundation/ddse-foundation/blob/main/tools/tdr_validator.py)
2. Paste your TDR content
3. Get instant feedback on compliance

**Option B: Python Validator**
```bash
# Download the validator
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddse-foundation/ddse-foundation/main/tools/tdr_validator.py

# Validate your TDR
python tdr_validator.py idr-001-input-validation.md
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ TDR Structure: Valid
‚úÖ Required Sections: Present  
‚úÖ AI Context: Complete
‚úÖ Cross-references: Valid
üéâ TDR passes all validation checks!
```

### What You've Learned
- **TDRs provide structure** for technical decisions
- **AI context sections** guide tool behavior effectively  
- **Validation ensures quality** and compliance
- **Consistency improves** when AI tools follow documented patterns

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Try another decision**: Pick a different technical choice and create another TDR
2. **Share with your team**: Show them the AI-generated code quality difference
3. **Build your TDR library**: Document 3-5 key decisions over the next week

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "My AI tool isn't following the TDR patterns"
- **Check AI context sections**: Make sure they're specific and actionable
- **Be more explicit**: Add concrete examples and constraint enforcement
- **Try different prompts**: "Following the exact patterns in this TDR..."

### "The TDR feels too formal for my small project"
- **Start lighter**: Use just the Decision Context, Outcome, and AI Context sections
- **Focus on value**: Only document decisions that actually need consistency
- **Grow gradually**: Add more structure as your project and team grows

### "I'm not sure which TDR type to use"
- **IDR for implementation**: Specific coding patterns and conventions
- **EDR for engineering**: Cross-cutting technical approaches  
- **ADR for architecture**: Major structural and technology decisions
- **MDD for strategy**: Business and product-level constraints
