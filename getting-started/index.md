## 🎓 Why These Three Foundations Matter

### 🔥 **The Manifesto** - Philosophy & Vision

The DDSE Manifesto articulates our core beliefs about software engineering in the AI era. It establishes why decisions should be first-class citizens and how human-AI collaboration can be structured through decision governance.

**Key Insights:**

- Decisions over documentation
- Explicit over implicit choices  
- Evolution over stagnation
- Human authority in AI collaboration

### ⚖️ **The Specification** - Implementation Standards

The DDSE Specification v1.0 provides complete technical standards for implementing DDSE methodology, including TDR hierarchies, organizational structures, and tooling requirements.

**Core Components:**

- TDR taxonomy (MDD, ADR, EDR, IDR, TDM)
- Directory organization standards
- AI integration requirements
- Compliance and governance frameworks

### 🎯 **Decision Memory** - Historical Context

Understanding how decision records evolved in industry practice provides crucial context for why DDSE emerged and how it addresses fundamental challenges in software engineering knowledge preservation.

**Historical Evolution:**

- From tribal knowledge to documented decisions
- Industry adoption of Architectural Decision Records
- The emergence of decision-driven methodologies
- AI era requirements for structured decision context
